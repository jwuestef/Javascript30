    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);






    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "Lux";
    console.log(players, team);   //UPDATES BOTH OF THEM
                                  // "team" and "player" are just pointers to the data, unlike strings/numbers/booleans

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();   //slice the whole array into team2
    team[2] = "Mooha";
    console.log(players, team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];   //spreads the contents of players into this new array

    const team5 = Array.from(players);  //also works

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed






    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    console.log(person);  //original "person" will have number=99 too!

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    console.log(person, cap2);    //now it won't affect the original!!  (*note: due to the above example, )

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}   BUT right now it doesn't work! Hopefully added soon







    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
        name: "Wes",
        age: 180,
        social: {
            twitter: "@wesbos",
            facebook: "wesbos.developer"
        }
    };
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    dev.name = "Wesley";    //won't affect original

    dev.social.twitter = "@coolman";
    //WILL AFFECT ORIGINAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   .assign only cloans 1 level deep, anything past is still a pointer to the old data
    //can find deep clone functions on the internet

    //"poorman"s way of doing it... not recommended... turn it into JSON and back... will also work
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
